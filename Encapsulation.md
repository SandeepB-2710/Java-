### 1. What is encapsulation in Java?
Answer:
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit and hiding the internal details from outside access. 
It is achieved by making variables private and providing public methods to access and modify them.

## 2. How do you achieve encapsulation in Java?
Answer:
By declaring the class variables as private and creating public getter and setter methods to access and update those variables.

## 3. What is the main purpose of encapsulation?
Answer:
The main purpose of encapsulation is to protect data from unwanted access or modification. It allows the class to control what values are allowed and how the data is used.

## 4. Can you explain encapsulation with a real-life example?
Answer:
Yes. An ATM machine is a good example. You can only access your account through specific options (buttons), and you cannot directly modify your bank balance. The machine controls how your request is handled. This is similar to encapsulation, where the class controls access to its data.
